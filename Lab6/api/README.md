## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/n-n06/Web-Dev.git
   cd Web-Dev/Lab6/api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add any necessary environment variables, such as database connection strings or API keys.

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The API should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Usage

After setting up and starting the server, you can interact with the API using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/). The API allows you to perform CRUD operations on the resources.

## Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /albums`: Retrieve a list of albums.
- `GET /albums/:id`: Retrieve a specific album by ID.
- `PATCH /resources/:id`: Update an existing album's by ID.
- `DELETE /resources/:id`: Delete an album by ID.
